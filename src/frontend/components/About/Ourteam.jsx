      Person_content: `Shri Gopal Sharma, an eminent educationist, a good Samaritan, a repository of knowledge, a true karma yogi, who transformed the education scenario in the quaint industrial town of Faridabad and catapulted the backyard of National Capital to the National Level.
A city with well-established brands of educational institutes was left gasping with wonder when Sir entered the education sector in 1983 with the establishment of Modern Vidya Niketan School in Faridabad. A tale of capturing dreams and turning them into reality began at MVN, where values and education in sync define excellence in education. He firmly believed that a school should aim at building an integrated personality that is a harmonious balance of our body, our thoughts, and our aspirations which helps a child to realize his/her unique potential.
He could gauge the demand of thousands of students who were clamoring for quality education and made this as his mission of life.
What sets apart the peerless from the prosaic is their vision, mission and commitment. As former President APJ Abdul Kalam said “Dream is not that which you see while sleeping; It is something that does not let you sleep”. Shri Gopal Sharma Sir always exhorted the students to Dream big to Achieve big.`,
