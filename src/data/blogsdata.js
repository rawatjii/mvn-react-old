          description: `The Real Estate market has always been dominant over others because of the tremendous returns it offers to its investors. Land is always considered as the major asset of the individual because the value only grows with time. There is a well-known phrase, "safe as a house" and it's actually true. According to research by AMP, Indian property has increased in value at a rate comparable to that of the stock market since 1947 – an average of 11.4% per annum – in defiance of a succession of wars, disasters, recessions, and crises.
<br>
<br>
Real Estate saw a downfall last year due to the pandemic, and builders have incurred huge losses on their projects as no one was investing in the property. Still, the trust in the Real Estate market hasn't been shackled a bit, the reason being the capacity of this sector to create wonders for the people. 
 <br>
 <br>
The best thing about Real Estate is you don't need specialist knowledge to start investing in property: in fact, many Indian property investors didn't start off aspiring to make their fortune through the property. Instead, they just purchased a house to live in. It's only after seeing the value of their home increase – and recognizing how much wealth they can generate – that many investors take the leap and start investing in the properties. Many of the property developers in Gurgaon did not have any background in this sector, but because of the availability of land, they jumped into it and today are making huge lumps of profit.

<br>
<br>

Let's focus our attention on the reasons that will show why investing in real estate is a good option for you.

          heading: "Reasons to Invest in Real Estate Market",
          description: `<ul>
            <li><b>Appreciation</b><br>
            
            <p class="mt-2">
            Real estate investors can generate wealth through rents, any gains created by property-aligned business activity, and appreciation. In real estate, property values tend to increase over time, and with a good investment, you can generate a mammoth profit when it's time to sell. As time passes by, even the rent increases (10 - 20%), which can lead to higher cash flow. The cash flow associated with real estate is easy to track and requires fewer efforts from the owner.

            </p>
            </li>


            <li><b>Ease of Financing</b>
            
                <p class="mt-2">
              Ease in Financing may not feel like it when you're applying for a mortgage, but lenders like property. Home loans are a crucial part of any bank's business model, and people are more likely to lend on residential property than any other asset class – as witnessed by the fact that they will lend a higher proportion of the value, like almost close to 100% and at lower interest rates than any other asset class. This motivates the investors to invest in properties rather than going for any other asset class.</p>
            </li>


            <li><b>Real Estate is Improvable</b>
            
                <p class="mt-2">
              To increase the worth of a property is in your hand, this cannot be possible in any other sector. If you renovate your flat or a house, your chances of getting good resale value will definitely increase. Since real estate is a substantial asset, any improvements you make will surely increase its value. Some things that bring the biggest return for your money are flooring, doors, and ceilings. </p>
            </li>

            <li><b>Real Estate Leverage</b>
            
                <p class="mt-2">
             Real estate is the only sector that provides huge leverage to its investors. Leverage is defined as the process of using various financial instruments or borrowed capital like debt to uplift an investment's potential return. A 20% down payment on a mortgage will get you 100% of the house you want to buy; that's how leverage helps investors. In NCR, many builders like MVN Infrastructure are offering a ready-to-move house in Faridabad which becomes a good opportunity with the advantage of leverage.  </p>
            </li>


            <li><b>Portfolio Diversification</b>
            
                <p class="mt-2">
             Investors always look for methods to lower the risks in their investments; real estate gives them the opportunity by providing different platforms like commercial offices, Plots, Flats, and independent houses. It ensures that if one area falls down a little, another is always there to balance it out.   </p>
            </li>


            <li><b>Tax Deductions</b>
            
                <p class="mt-2">
             Tax codes allow various deductions for the normal expenses aroused in owning real estate properties, such as apartment upkeep, maintenance, advancements, and also the interest paid on the mortgage. The deductions can build income and reduce your overall taxes. For first-time home buyers, tax deductions are more favourable. Most of the  Builders and Developers in Bangalore are associated with RERA, which improves their authenticity and also helps investors get tax deductions easily.   </p>
            </li>

            <li><b>Inflation Hedge</b>
            
                <p class="mt-2">
             Inflation affects every investment and impacts the functioning of that sector, but real estate is an investment that is almost always in demand, so it basically maintains its monetary power. Normal inflation often creates hurdles for companies to create products and services. They either have to increase their prices or accept lower profits. Real estate does not get affected by such inflation; because of this prominent feature, it comes out as a natural Inflation hedge. </p>
            </li>
